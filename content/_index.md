## About Me

**Hi there, and welcome!**

I’m **Alex Lozko**, a passionate and detail-oriented **Software QA Automation Engineer** with over **8 years** of professional experience in delivering high-quality software through robust automated testing.  

With a strong foundation in both manual and automated QA, I’ve built and maintained test automation frameworks from scratch for **web, mobile, and API testing** across a range of industries, including **public safety**, **digital forensics**, and **enterprise applications**.

I specialize in tools and technologies such as **Selenium**, **Playwright**, **Cypress**, **TestNG**, **NUnit**, **Pytest**, **Robot Framework**, **Cucumber**, and **Appium**, and have hands-on experience using multiple programming languages including **Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript/TypeScript**.

I’m deeply familiar with **CI/CD processes** and have integrated automated tests into pipelines using **Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins**, and **Docker**.

Throughout my career, I’ve been committed to not only **finding bugs**, but **preventing them** — collaborating closely with development teams, contributing to **shift-left testing strategies**, and continuously improving **test coverage, reliability, and performance**.

I have worked in **Agile/Scrum environments**, participated in all key ceremonies, and mentored junior engineers to elevate overall team performance.

My professional background also includes deep technical experience as a **Systems Engineer in the nuclear energy sector**, where I worked on **mission-critical software and hardware systems**.

I’m **ISTQB**, **Microsoft Azure** and **Oracle Database** certified, and always eager to learn new tools and explore better ways to ensure quality in software delivery.
